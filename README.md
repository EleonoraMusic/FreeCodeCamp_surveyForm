# FreeCodeCamp challange#2: a Survey Form
My second html/css page

### The story behind
This form was developed as my second project to gain the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form).
Those were the <b>user stories</b>: 

### User Stories:
* I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.
* I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.
* I can see a form with id="survey-form".
* Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".
* Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".
* If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
* Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".
* If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
* If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
* For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".
* For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
* Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding id="dropdown".
* Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.
* Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.
* Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.
* Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to submit all my inputs.

### Comment:
In this second project you will see that the web design is turning a bit more complex, with a background image and a second layer in front of it, accomplished using pseudo element "::before". 
I tried to do my best to make this project responsive and, in the end, I'm quite satisfied with that.
